## Abstract

How can a team of two manage CI/CD for thousands of open source repositories scattered across tens of organizations without losing any sleep? This session highlights an efficient approach to managing CI/CD at scale which we employed at [Protocol Labs](https://github.com/protocol/.github).  It provides insights into distributing GitHub Actions workflows, accepting contributions, maintaining high standards of health and security for all repositories, and continuously monitoring their state. The talk underscores how to achieve all of the above while maintaining a serene working environment.

## Key Takeaways

- Learn how to efficiently manage CI/CD at scale in the open.
- Understand how to maintain the health and security of a repository.
- Learn how to maintain work-life balance while handling large projects.
