## Abstract

GitHub configuration management can be complex, particularly for large-scale open source organizations. This session offers a practical guide to managing anything from organization members to repository settings, labels or even files as code. It shows how we do it at [Protocol Labs](https://github.com/protocol/github-mgmt-template) and explores how it allows us to leverage version control, enhance auditing processes, script workflows, and enforce consistent standards across thousands of repositories. Finally, it dispels the myth that embracing this method requires breaking existing habits.

## Key Takeaways

- Learn how to manage diverse aspects of GitHub configuration as code.
- Discover the benefits of this approach.
- Understand that adopting this strategy does not necessitate a disruption of existing habits.
