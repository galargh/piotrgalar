title: Transition to Go 1.19 and Enhanced Testing
date: 2022-08-18
---

## Highlights

👑 **Go 1.19 is out!** Go workflows will use Go 1.18 and Go 1.19 from now on. Testing with Go 1.17 is being dropped - you can start using generics!

🔀 **Shuffle is on!** The Go test workflow will now shuffle the order in which the tests are being executed which should improve the quality of the test suites.

🦝 **Technical Previews!** You can now opt-in to receive technical preview updates of Unified CI in-between major releases. In fact, you can use [this guide](https://github.com/protocol/.github#technical-preview) right now to receive this update ahead of the release schedule.
