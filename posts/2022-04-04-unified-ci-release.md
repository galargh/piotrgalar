title: Announcing Unified CI with Go 1.18 and JS support
date: 2022-04-04
---

## Highlights

- 👑 **Go 1.18 is out!** Go workflows will use Go 1.17 and Go 1.18 from now on. Testing with Go 1.16 is being dropped.
- ♻️ **Automerge is becoming reusable!** This will allow us to keep improving the workflow even in-between major Unified CI releases.
- 🔧 **Automerge in JS is fixed!** The workflow will start to work correctly in JS repositories even if some checks are skipped.
- 🛣️ **PATH for go test on 386 is customisable!** Go test workflow will now support PATH customisation for the step running on 32 bit machines.
