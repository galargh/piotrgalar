_GitHub Universe Edition: Day 2 🎮🎮_

🇺🇦 Today’s keynote opened with a feature from [nrc.no](http://nrc.no) on how they’re helping Ukrainian refugees during the Russian invasion through Open Source! Loads of interesting projects and donation options at their site - [nrc.no](http://nrc.no). For info on current events and even more donation options, you can visit [https://war.ukraine.ua/](https://war.ukraine.ua/) 🇺🇦

It’s another packed day ahead of us - stay tuned for more 🧪

🚤 Checkouts are apparently quite a bit quicker in codespaces. Duh! I really need to find some time to spend using them.

🔒 2fa is gonna be required by the end of next year all around GitHub 🎉

🕺 [terraform-aws-github-runner](https://github.com/philips-labs/terraform-aws-github-runner) had a presentation! Kudos! It’s a brilliant piece of software. We’re using it! See [tf-aws-gh-runner](https://github.com/pl-strflt/tf-aws-gh-runner). If you have a use case for self-hosted runners, please reach out!

🔓 Private vulnerability reporting is getting API and org-level setting… eventually. From what I gathered it’s not on a roadmap yet 😞 Either way, let’s discuss which repos we want this in first!

That’s a wrap for me for today - attended a cool conference AND released a [new version of Kubo](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases/tag/v0.17.0-rc1) - what a day 😉 I’ll go through my notes to see if I didn’t miss anything when I’m back. See you all on Monday 🌴🍹
