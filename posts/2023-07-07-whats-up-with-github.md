🔥 What’s new in GitHub? is back! 🔥

🤹 When we set up default code scanning, it’s going to [update itself automatically whenever the set of languages used in a repo changes](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-06-26-code-scanning-default-setup-automatically-updates-when-the-languages-in-the-repository-change/).
You can now also choose [which languages should be covered by code scanning](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-06-15-choose-which-languages-to-enable-in-code-scanning-default-setup-for-your-repository/) by default. And filter alerts by [language and/or path](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-06-20-code-scanning-can-filter-alerts-by-language-and-file-path/). And [security searches can be performed cross-repo](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-06-23-use-github-code-search-to-support-security-research-with-multi-repository-variant-analysis-for-codeql-beta/). That’s a lot! Reminder - we want to set up default code scanning globally once we can configure it via API.

📏 Custom repository rulesets now have [configurable bypass lists](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-06-27-repository-rules-public-beta-updates/)… are we one step closer to enforcing branch protection rules for everyone except bots?

💬 [Copilot Chat now works together with popular debuggers](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-06-29-copilot-june-2023-update/), providing more insights into encountered exceptions. If you haven’t signed up for Copilot Chat yet, you can do it [here](https://github.com/github-copilot/chat_waitlist_signup/join).

😻 [Grouped Dependabot Updates](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-06-30-grouped-version-updates-for-dependabot-public-beta/)!

🐧 Node actions now use [Node16 instead of Node12](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-06-13-github-actions-all-actions-will-run-on-node16-instead-of-node12-by-default/) by default. If you missed all the fun we had with it, you can go back to [this thread](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C03KLC57LKB/p1686680229440949).

🎨 [The redesigned navigation reached public beta](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-06-15-redesigned-navigation-enabled-for-all-users-beta/). You can enable it for yourself via Feature Preview. And read more about it [here](https://github.blog/2023-06-15-exploring-github-with-the-redesigned-navigation-now-in-public-beta/).

🗄️ You can now archive not only repos but also [entire orgs](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-06-15-organization-archiving-public-beta/).

🔘 There’s a new [button for adding task lists](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-06-15-github-issues-projects-june-15th-update/#%E2%9E%95-add-tasklist-button) on issues (both in project and in classic view).

🛑 [If Dependabot fails 30 times, it will stop pushing updates for that repo](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-06-21-skip-scheduled-dependabot-runs-after-30-failures/).

🤖 There’s a new bot in town, [Merge Queue Bot](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-06-21-merges-by-pull-request-merge-queue-now-attributed-to-the-github-merge-queue-bot/). It will be used for merging PRs that are in merge queue.

🌐 [How to build a Chrome extension with GitHub Copilot](https://github.blog/2023-05-12-how-i-used-github-copilot-to-build-a-browser-extension/).

☸️ Want to learn more about the complexity of scaling projects like Kubernetes? Listen to [this podcast](https://github.blog/2023-06-21-bridging-code-and-community/).

💁 There’s a [prompt guide for GitHub Copilot](https://github.blog/2023-06-20-how-to-write-better-prompts-for-github-copilot/).

🔐 Cool! There’s an action out there that could help us determine what’s [the minimal permissions each workflow needs](https://github.blog/2023-06-26-new-tool-to-secure-your-github-actions/).
