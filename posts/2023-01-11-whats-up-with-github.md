Let’s enter new year with new **What’s new in GitHub?** 🎉🎉

🦀 [Advanced code navigation is available for Rust](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-11-09-search-based-code-navigation-for-rust-projects/)

🤫 It is now possible to [require approval on workflow runs from private forks](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-11-14-github-actions-require-approval-for-running-workflows-from-private-forks/)

⏩ GitHub CLI now comes with [webhook forwarding](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-11-16-webhook-forwarding-in-the-github-cli-public-beta/) - it’s going to be really useful for testing

📝 GitHub API docs should be more accurate now that they’re [generated from the OpenAPI Schema](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-11-16-webhook-docs-generated-from-the-openapi-schema/)

🔄 If you’re thinking of porting your CI workflows to GitHub Actions, you might want to join the waitlist for the [GitHub Actions importer](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-11-16-introducing-github-actions-importer/)

🤨 There’s a new view where you can manage all your [open GitHub sessions](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-11-16-new-session-and-device-management-settings-page/)

🧱 In GitHub Projects, you can now [turn draft issues into concrete ones in any repository you have access to](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-11-17-github-issues-november-17th-update/) - no more organization boundaries

🕐 [Workflow job webhook events](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-11-22-webhook-enhancements-for-environment-protection-rules/) will support `waiting` state (when they’re waiting for env protection rules)

📅 Notice about repo archive status now comes with a [date when the repo was archived](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-11-23-repository-archive-date-now-shown-in-ui/)

🗓️ API is now [versioned with calendar dates](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-11-28-calendar-based-versioning-for-the-rest-api/)

:slack: GitHub app in Slack now supports [GitHub Actions workflow notifications](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-12-06-github-actions-workflow-notifications-in-slack-and-microsoft-teams/)

👶 You can [rename repositories during transfer](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-12-12-rename-repositories-while-transferring-them/)

🪦 And [unarchive repos through API](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-12-13-unarchive-a-repository-via-the-rest-api/)

🔒 The [actions and reusable workflows from private repositories can now be shared with other private repositories](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-12-14-github-actions-sharing-actions-and-reusable-workflows-from-private-repositories-is-now-ga/) within the same org.

🖨️ [SECRET SCANNING IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR FREE ON PUBLIC REPOS](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-12-15-secret-scanning-is-now-available-for-free-on-public-repositories/) - I’ll look into how to enable it everywhere. [Listing enablement status](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-12-20-code-security-enablement-settings-on-the-list-organization-repositories-rest-api/) is accessible through the API. 🤞 so is enabling it.

🗄️ GitHub Projects now comes with [automated issue archiving](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-12-22-github-issues-december-22nd-update/).

🔗 GitHub Projects now offers more [linking options](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-01-05-github-issues-january-5th-update/) too.

🍝 [CODE SCANNING CAN NOW BE ENABLED WITHOUT COMMITTING ANY CODE TO THE REPO](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-01-09-code-scanning-can-be-set-up-more-easily-without-committing-a-workflow-file-to-the-repository/) - only available on the repo level and I don’t think there’s API for that but I’ll see if we could enable it on scale 👀

:eyes: There’s a public beta for [org-wide required workflows](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-01-10-github-actions-support-for-organization-wide-required-workflows-public-beta/). One definition, required on PRs everywhere. It’ll be interesting to see how it develops.

🧊 GitHub Actions now supports [configuration variables](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-01-10-github-actions-support-for-configuration-variables-in-workflows/) - think repo secrets that are not so secret.
