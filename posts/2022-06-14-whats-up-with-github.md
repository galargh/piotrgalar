## What's new in GitHub?

**New Products**
üèÖ You can now create GitHub native courses with GitHub Skills. It was created through a mix of GitHub Actions and template repositories. [GitHub Skills](https://github.blog/2022-06-06-introducing-github-skills/)

üîí GitHub open-sourced a project it uses for IAM internally - Entitlements. TLDR: It can take pull information about org structure from LDAP, other repo, etc. and create org and team memberships. At a first glance, it is too little to replace GitHub Management for us, but it's certainly going to be a great source of inspiration.

ü¶î GitHub Achievements! More badges on your profile! It'd be cool if it was possible to create internal achievements, but I don't think it's coming any time soon.

**GitHub Actions**
ü¶Ñ They've finally unified how one can access inputs in `workflow_dispatch` and `workflow_call` workflows. [GitHub Actions Inputs Unified Across Manual and Reusable Workflows](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-06-10-github-actions-inputs-unified-across-manual-and-reusable-workflows/)

üï∏Ô∏è Here's a neat little post about how to connect to a private network from hosted runners. [Connecting to a Private Network from GitHub Hosted Actions Runners](https://github.blog/2022-06-01-connecting-to-a-private-network-from-github-hosted-actions-runners/)

**Security**
‚õìÔ∏è Supply chain security features are now available for Rust too! [GitHub Brings Supply Chain Security Features to the Rust Community](https://github.blog/2022-06-06-github-brings-supply-chain-security-features-to-the-rust-community/)
