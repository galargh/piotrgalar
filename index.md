title: About
---

I'm the Co-Founder and Tech Lead of [IPDX.co](https://ipdx.co) - the Developer Experience consulting service. I strongly believe a human-centric approach is the key to championing productivity in the software development space. I strive to empower developers to focus on what they do best - innovate.

I specialise in enhancing workflows through automation, which has been my main focus for the past 6 years. At Protocol Labs, the team I led changed how 300+ developers work across 1000+ open-source repositories. Before, at Sumo Logic, the team I built transformed the organisation through large-scale CI and build systems migrations and redesigns.

These and many other experiences are part of my ongoing commitment to improving the work, well-being and happiness of developers through better tools, systems, and processes.
