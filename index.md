I'm the Co-Founder of IPDX with over eight years of experience in the industry. I specialize in building and leading Developer Experience teams.

At Protocol Labs, I looked over thousands of open-source repositories and improved workflows for 300+ developers. Previously, at Sumo Logic, I also founded a Developer Experience team, with a strong focus on software delivery.

These experiences are part of my ongoing commitment to positively impacting the work and well-being of developers through better tools, systems, and processes.
