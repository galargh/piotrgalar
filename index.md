title: About

I'm a senior software engineer and technical leader passionate about developer experience. I firmly believe a human-centric approach is the key to championing productivity in the software development space. I strive to empower developers to focus on what they do best - innovate.

I specialise in enhancing workflows through automation, which has been my main focus for the past 7 years. At Protocol Labs, the team I led changed how 300+ developers work across 1000+ open-source repositories. Before, at Sumo Logic, the team I built transformed the organisation through large-scale CI and build systems migrations and redesigns.

These and many other experiences are part of my ongoing commitment to improving developers' work, well-being and happiness through better tools, systems, and processes.
