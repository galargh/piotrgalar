I'm the Co-Founder and CTO of [IPDX.co](https://ipdx.co) - the Developer Experience consulting service. I specialise in enhancing developers' quality of life through automation, which has been my main focus for the past 6 years.

At Protocol Labs, the team I led looked over thousands of open-source repositories and improved workflows for 300+ developers. Before this, at Sumo Logic, my team introduced innovative strategies for software distribution, which proved to be transformative for the organization.

These experiences are part of my ongoing commitment to positively impacting the work and well-being of developers through better tools, systems, and processes.
